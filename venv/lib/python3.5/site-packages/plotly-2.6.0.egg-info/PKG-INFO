        It's all about the graphs.

        The Nutshell
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Use this package to make collaborative, interactive,
        publication-quality graphs from Python.
        
        Here's how you import::
        
            import plotly.plotly as py              # for sending things to plotly
            import plotly.tools as tls              # for mpl, config, etc.
            from plotly.graph_objs import *         # __all__ is safely defined
        
        Here's how you sign in::
        
            py.sign_in('PythonAPI', 'ubpiol2cve')   # get your own at https://plot.ly/
        
        Here's how you plot data or a figure::
        
            py.plot(data_or_figure_here)
        
        Here's what you get:
        
        * an account on plotly
        * a unique url for your data/figures
        * an interactive web-application to edit your figure or make new figures
        * a platform on which to share your data/figures with the world
        
        You can also convert supported matplotlib figures::
        
            py.plot_mpl(mplfig)
        
        Stop fighting with your figures; start designing them. Check out our
        Quickstart_ to get going.
        
        
        About
        ~~~~~
        
        Plotly_ is an online collaborative data analysis and graphing tool. The
        Python API allows you to access all of Plotly's functionality from Python.
        Plotly figures are shared, tracked, and edited all online and the data is
        always accessible from the graph.
        
        That's it. Find out more, sign up, and start sharing by visiting us at

        Install via pip
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Assuming you have already installed pip, you can simply enter the following
        in a terminal program::

        Plotly, matplotlib, and mpld3
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The matplotlylib sub-package allows you to convert matplotlib figures to
        plotly figures, with a one-liner::
        
            py.plot_mpl(fig)
        
        Checkout the `Plotly and mpld3`_ IPython notebook for more information.
        
        Introduction to working with out API

        Details
        ~~~~~~~
        
        The plotly package depends on requests, which will be installed by pip for you.
        
        To use the matplotlylib subpackage, you'll also need to have matplotlib 1.3.1
        properly installed on your machine.
        
        The matpotlylib package is based on the mplexporter framework for crawling
        and exporting matplotlib images.
